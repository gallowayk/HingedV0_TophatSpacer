# HingedV0_TophatSpacer [BETA]

If you print them before it exits beta stage, please be warned that things may change. Use draft settings for now. :) Please provide feedback; it will help refine the design and also help me grow as a designer. Once the design has been validated and confirmed to work, I will release the .STEP file(s).

This was heavily inspired by, but is not a remix of, the excellent design by 93djen (https://www.printables.com/model/109713-voron-v01-tophat-spacer-with-hinges).


After printing theirs and installing it, I felt like some quality of life adjustments could be made. Rather than attempt modification of theirs, this was modeled from the ground up using the openly available V0.1 step file. 

 

All files can be printed without support. Find the flattest surface and place that on the print bed.

 
Post processing: The current design has fairly tight tolerances on the holes for the tophat posts; be sure to use a deburring tool or hobby knife to ensure they are reamed slightly. Iâ€™ll loosen the tolerances on the next release.
